# Mana Visualizer

We all know and love Botania, right? The very famous magi- *checks notes* tech mod. However I'm sure you've wondered before "how much mana do I need?" just to look at your pool and compare it with the recipe just for that to give you no explanation. Or maybe you're working on a modpack and would like to compare your numbers with existing recipe numbers without having to open up the recipe jsons (that was me). I have just the solution for you! Mana Visualizer lets you now see numbers for your mana pools, mana storing items, and mana consuming recipes (EMI & REI only).
